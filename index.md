# Projects 
## Customer Churn Analysis 
#### Built a churn analysis project combining Tableau dashboards and machine learning models to identify customer risk factors and visualize churn patterns. Focused on clarity, reproducibility, and actionable insights for stakeholders.
- Initial analysis was done in SQL, where I calculated churn percentages across categorical features.
- Data cleaning was also performed in SQL, converting string fields into numerical categories and removing null values, while retaining outliers to focus on real‑world churn reasons.
- Built visualizations in Python to gain deeper insights into the data.
- Trained an XGBoost model, evaluated with a confusion matrix, and extracted feature importance to highlight the strongest predictors of churn.

- Whale Migration Predictor - A Simple introduction into ML models and visualisation. I exctracted data from an online migration database cleaned the data and put them into a nueral net on the right and a K nearest neighbours on the left. From this model we can see whales are very habitual in their migration patterns.

- Emotion Recognition System - audio feature extraction with a neural net for prediction. Works well ass its own model but struggles in the GUI likely due to background noise when recording. On the left is the GUI on the right is the Classification Report.
